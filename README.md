# <Module One Challenge>

## Description

The intention of this project was to edit the codebase of the webpage for Horiseon Social Solution Services so that it followed accessibility standards. The CSS was reworked to be more efficient by consolidating selectors and properties, as well as organizing them to follow the structure of the HTML elements. Comments were added before each section of the HTML and CSS page to make it easier to navigate. Alt attributes were added to the images to make them more accessible, and the heading attributes were edited to fall in a sequential order.
